## Getting started with JSS

To develop a JSS application, you need:

- An operating system supported by Node (Mac, Windows, Linux).
- Node. We recommend using the latest long-term support (LTS) release.

> To run a JSS application in production or develop using Sitecore data you need to connect your application to a Sitecore instance with the Headless Services module installed (requires a **Sitecore Headless Services license**). Sitecore _requires Windows_, but the Sitecore instance does not need to be local. You can use a Sitecore instance installed in a virtual machine or on a remote server.

### Getting started with the latest version of JSS

To create a JSS project:

1. In a terminal, run one of the following commands and follow the prompts:

   ```
   npx @sitecore-content-sdk/create-sitecore-jss
   ```

2. Change directory to your application folder:
   ```
   cd my-first-jss-app
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   jss start
   ```
